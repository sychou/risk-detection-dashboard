Hey [@Chuck](https://isomer-ai-inc.slack.com/team/U095ZT93W5P) - more prompt ideas:  

- Is this the first communication or is this a reply in a thread? Make it show that as a field but also make it question if it's new information that warrants flagging or if it's back and forth and doesn't have new information.
- At the end of the prompt, ask it to review the decision, risk flag, and reasoning as a senior claims manager who wants to surface real signals, but reduce noise from false positives.

Just curious how far prompt engineering can take it. Lmk if you've already incorporated. I've not looked at the prompts. I'm just looking at this output.
